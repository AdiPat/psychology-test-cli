# Psychology Test CLI (WIP)

A CLI that generates psychology tests that can be used as games, marketing campaigns or for general evaluation of human behaviour.

I want to build this as a CLI because I want it to have the "programmer" feel to it. I expect the user to know basic commands to get this to run.

I will provide instructions to run this as soon as I complete v0.0.1!
